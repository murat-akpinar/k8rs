//! It reads Kubernetes objects out of JSON files named on the command line, runs the rule
//! engine over them and prints what is broken. **It cannot reach a cluster**: `k8s.rs` is
//! Phase 5, which is where `--once` and the v0.0.1 release therefore sit. Until then this is
//! how the rules are exercised for real (CLAUDE.md § Running it).
//!
//! The output is `screens/once.md`'s card, minus the two things that need a later phase —
//! owner grouping and its `3 of 5 pods` count, and recency as a second sort key (Phase 10) —
//! and plus one that is not a phase: it draws the `Info` band `--once` will not, because a
//! driver whose whole job is to show what `analyze` returned may not drop one of them, and
//! Phase 5's `--once` box takes the band off (NOTES § D121).
//! It may not invent a third format: one `rules.rs`, one set of strings.

// A module no `mod` line reaches is not in the crate at all, so `rules.rs` is declared the
// moment it exists rather than when something calls it (NOTES § D34).
